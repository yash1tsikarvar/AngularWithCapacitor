  Therefore, we have partnered with MasterCard, to provide an Income Verification tool that is convenient, accurate, and secure.<br>
  Created with the highest level of encryption in mind, our Verification Tool ensures that only the data relevant to your application is forwarded to the Association.<br>
  Sensitive information, such as your log in credentials, account numbers, or routing numbers are never visible to either Tenant Evaluation nor the community you are applying for.
